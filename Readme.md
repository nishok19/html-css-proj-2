## Learnings ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Technologies-HTML-orange) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Technology-CSS-green)

This is the second project in the HTML and CSS class. I have learnt how to set the background image and a hue on top of it. Positioning is used as for aligning elements in the webpage.

## Efforts

This project took around 2 hours to build. Figuring out how to make the background took more time.
